# Libft
This 42 project involves creating a library called Libft which includes many various functions that can prove useful for other projects. Some of the functions are already included in C 
standard libraries. For instance ft_strlen and ft_strncmp can already be found in the <string.h> library. Coding them from scratch was still a fruitful experience as it involves developing
a fundamnetal understanding of how these functions work as well as their error-handling. Other functions, however, cannot be found in C standard libraries and have proved to be very useful
in other projects. Some of these functions include but are not limited to ft_strjoin, ft_split, and ft_substr. 

The bonus part includes functions that help in creating and manipulating linked lists. These functions are very efficient and helpful, especially when it comes to working with more complex
data structures like stacks and queues in C.
